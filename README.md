Description: 'The project adresses the topic of treasury yields and bond prices, conducting a sentiment analysis of tweet data. Tweets are first scraped and filtered. Sentiment scores are then attributed using VADER and sentiment thresholds determined using K-means clustering. Sentiment is aggreagated daily as positive, neutral, or negative. A trading strategy is then built and backtested, with sentiment shifts serving as trade signals.'
